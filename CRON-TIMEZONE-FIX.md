# 🕐 Timezone Fix for cron-job.org

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
The bot was calculating booking times in France timezone (UTC+2) but running in UTC, causing incorrect wait times.

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
Updated the bot to convert France time to UTC for consistent timing.

## 🔧 **Updated cron-job.org Schedule:**

Since the bot now correctly converts France time to UTC, your cron jobs should be:

### **Original Schedule (France Time):**
- Wednesday 07:29:57 → books Monday class
- Thursday 10:59:57 → books Tuesday class  
- Friday 07:29:57 → books Wednesday class
- Saturday 08:34:57 → books Thursday class
- Sunday 12:59:57 → books Friday class

### **Updated Schedule (UTC Time for cron-job.org):**
- Wednesday 05:29:57 UTC → books Monday class
- Thursday 08:59:57 UTC → books Tuesday class  
- Friday 05:29:57 UTC → books Wednesday class
- Saturday 06:34:57 UTC → books Thursday class
- Sunday 10:59:57 UTC → books Friday class

## 📋 **Update Your cron-job.org Jobs:**

### Job 1: Monday Class
- **Schedule:** `57 29 5 * * 3` (Wednesday 05:29:57 UTC)

### Job 2: Tuesday Class  
- **Schedule:** `57 59 8 * * 4` (Thursday 08:59:57 UTC)

### Job 3: Wednesday Class
- **Schedule:** `57 29 5 * * 5` (Friday 05:29:57 UTC)

### Job 4: Thursday Class
- **Schedule:** `57 34 6 * * 6` (Saturday 06:34:57 UTC)

### Job 5: Friday Class
- **Schedule:** `57 59 10 * * 0` (Sunday 10:59:57 UTC)

## 🎯 **Why This Fixes It:**

- **Before:** Bot waited 2+ hours (wrong timezone calculation)
- **After:** Bot will wait the correct time until booking opens
- **Result:** Precise 3-second-early booking timing

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

1. **Update your cron jobs** with the new UTC times above
2. **Test with a manual trigger** to verify timing
3. **Monitor the logs** to see correct wait times

The bot will now correctly calculate booking times in UTC and wait the proper amount of time!
